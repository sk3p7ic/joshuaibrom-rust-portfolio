# My Porfolio V3: The Inevitable Rust Re-Write.

This is the third iteration of my personal portfolio website (that I've kept
track of). Other iterations are:

1. [sk3p7ic/astro.joshuaibrom.com](https://github.com/sk3p7ic/astro.joshuaibrom.com)
1. [sk3p7ic/astro-v2.joshuaibrom.com](https://github.com/sk3p7ic/astro-v2.joshuaibrom.com)

## Motivation

There's no real motivation behind this re-write. Astro already checks the box
for statically-compiled markup and makes image optimization much simpler but
there was an itch for building a website using Rust that I have been wanting to
scratch and I finally caved. I would like to assume that should I intend to add
more features, such as the utilization of some database, the process should be
simpler using Rust than it would be needing to reacclimate myself with the Astro
docs and the rapidly-changing JavaScript ecosystem.

I'm a junior software engineer / web developer and MS Computer Science graduate
student from San Antonio, Texas working to further my skillset. I have recently
graduated from Texas A&M University - San Antonio where I studied computer
science. I have a background in Java, Python, and various web technologies such
as React, Svelte, and Astro. Other interests include the Rust and Zig
programming languages, especially as they relate to memory management.
